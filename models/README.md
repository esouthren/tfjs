These models still use deeplearnjs 0.5.0 (and thus cannot be used in a context that also loads TensorFlow.js). We are in the process of updating these and will likely migrate them out of this repository. We are keeping them here mainly for historical reasons, we suggest new users look at [tensorflow/tfjs-examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples) for examples on how to bring pre-trained models into TensorFlow.js
